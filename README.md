## Algorithm 

Algorithm is a set of well-defined instruction to solve a particular problems. 

### Qualities of Good Algorithms
* Input and output should be well-defined.
* Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
* Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
* An algorithm should be able written independent from any programing languages.(pseudo code)

## Data Structure

Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

### Types of Data Structure

Data structures are categorized as linear and non-linear types by considering the arrangement of the elements. 

#### Linear data structure

In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.

* Array Data Structure
* Stack Data Structure
* Queue Data Structure
* Linked List Data Structure

#### Non-linear data structure

Unlike linear data structures, elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence. Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.

* Graph Data Structure
* Trees Data Structure
  * Binary Tree
  * Binary Search Tree
  * AVL Tree
  * B-Tree
  * B+ Tree
  * Red-Black Tree

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The data items are arranged in sequential order, one after the other. | The data items are arranged in non-sequential order (hierarchical manner).             | 
| All the items are present on the single layer.                        | The data items are present at different layers.                                        | 
| It can be traversed on a single run.                                  | It requires multiple runs.                                                             |
| The memory utilization is not efficient.                              | Different structures utilize memory in different efficient ways depending on the need. |
| The time complexity increase with the data size.                      | Time complexity remains the same.                                                      | 
| Example: Arrays, Stack, Queue                                         | Example: Tree, Graph, Map                                                              |
